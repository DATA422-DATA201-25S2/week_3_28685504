## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

mean_data <- mtcars %>%
    group_by(cyl) %>%
    summarise(mean_disp = mean(disp))  

ggplot(mean_data, aes(x = factor(cyl), y = mean_disp)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity") + 
    labs(title = "mean engine displacement by cylinders",
         x = "cyl",
         y = "mean disp (cubic inches)")
